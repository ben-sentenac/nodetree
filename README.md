## TODO 

[ ] ### Refactor treeGenerator

    [ ] Memoize Ignored Files: If .ignore files appear repeatedly in nested directories, cache the ignored entries after the first read. This way, the same ignores are applied across all nested directories without redundant reads.
[ ] ### Refactor treeRecursive function
    [ ] 
[ ] ### Add Commnder and Command line arugments
