# nodetree


## TODO 

- [x] Refactor treeGenerator
- [x] add test for treeGenerator
- [x] Read .ignore File Only Once: 
- [x] Memoize Ignored Files: If .ignore files appear repeatedly in nested directories, 
cache the ignored entries after the first read. 
This way, the same ignores are applied across all nested directories without redundant reads.
- [ ] Refactor treeRecursive function
- [x] Add Commnder and Command line arugments 
- [ ] write output in file (ex:output.log) 
- [ ] add git-tracking files
