Project Documentation: Developers can include this directory structure in project documentation (e.g., README.md) to give an overview of the project's file organization.

Code Reviews: In a code review setting, it helps reviewers understand the layout of the codebase without needing to manually inspect the directory.

Data Organization: In data science projects or large file-based systems, it could help quickly audit or inspect folder structures.

Backup Validation: When validating backups or mirroring systems, it's useful to ensure that directory structures match between the source and destination.

Onboarding New Team Members: It helps new team members quickly familiarize themselves with the structure of the project.

Potential Feature Enhancements:
Here are some features you could consider adding to your program:

Filtering Options:

File Extensions: Allow users to filter the output by file types (e.g., .js, .txt, .sql).
File Size: Filter or highlight large files above a certain threshold.
Hidden Files: Add a flag to include or exclude hidden files (.env, .git, etc.).
File Metadata:

Last Modified Date: Add information about when files were last modified.
File Size: Show file sizes along with the directory tree.
Permissions: Display file or folder permissions.
Export to Other Formats:

Markdown: Output the tree as a Markdown-compatible format for easy inclusion in GitHub project documentation.
JSON or YAML: Provide output in structured data formats (JSON, YAML) for automation or programmatic use.
Interactive CLI:

Interactive View: Allow users to explore the directory structure interactively from the command line, similar to the tree command but with options for collapsing or expanding directories.
Search Capability: Implement a search feature to locate specific files within the tree.
Integration with Version Control:

Git Integration: Highlight untracked or modified files by interacting with Git to show changes in the file tree.
Branch Comparison: Compare directory structures between different Git branches (e.g., between main and a feature branch).
Visual Enhancements:

Colored Output: Use different colors to distinguish between directories, files, hidden files, and symlinks in the terminal output.
GUI Integration: If possible, create a graphical representation of the file structure using a web-based tool or desktop GUI.
Recursive Depth Limit:

Allow users to specify how deep the program should recurse into subdirectories. For instance, only list files up to 2 or 3 levels deep.
Ignore List:

Add the ability to ignore specific directories or files (e.g., node_modules, .git) using a .ignore file or CLI options.
Directory Size Aggregation:

Show the cumulative size of directories, which can help users find large directories taking up a lot of space.
Changes Over Time:

Provide an option to store and compare directory structures over time, helping to track what files or folders were added, removed, or modified between runs.
